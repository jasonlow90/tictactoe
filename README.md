#### TIC TAC TOE

It's a normal 3x3 Tic Tac Toe Game.

Start the game after you put in both the player's name and the choice of token.

Each player has a time limit of 10 seconds to make a move. The computer will randomly make a move for the player if a move is not made before the timer expires.

Click the crazy mode button if you are bored to see a fast random generated tic tac toe game.

### Future Work:

- Make a smart winning logic that allows a bigger tic tac toe grid size.
- Write an impossible to win program.

### Things to improve:

- Poor planning at the beginning of this project; Took me longer than expected to finish the timer function.
- Need to improve my problem solving approach; I should broken each part of the game into smaller sections and solve each section one      at a time for better time management and easier-to-read codes.
- Too many magic numbers. Need to work on my DRY and KISS.
